                    <p class ="scroll-animated-from-rigth">I was born and raised in Asuncion, Paraguay. I have always been an autodidact.
                         As a child I taught myself multiple subjects showing great interest in math, science, and technology.
                         When I was six I learned how to play chess by reading a simple cardboard instruction,
                         and by the time I was 10 I was building sophisticated catapults mechanism in the backyard of my house. 
                         This motivation in learning new things and the always-improving world of technology is what 
                         led me to become a Computer Engineer.</p>

                    <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">Thank you for taking the time to know more about me.

                                <p>The aim is to recreate the game Space Invaders on a PYNQ FPGA board by developing a hardware-software interface.
                                     I used C and Assembly language to design device-driver, monitor-debugger, and real-time kernel.
                                     I also used C++ for the game portion of the software because of its object-oriented capabilities.
                                     The game is simple: A ship that shoots bullets to an array of aliens that moves zigzag across the screen until it reaches the bunkers.
                                     At the end of the game the scores are displayed and the top ten best scores are saved.
                                     My current stage of development is to write kernel drivers to add sound to the game, and a Programmable Interval Timer</p>

                                <p> I can manage a system design project that interfaces digital hardware components 
                                    to an embedded system processor. I am also able to read and interpret device specifications 
                                    (data sheets) in order to integrate a device within a microprocessor based system.
                                    I can also design and implement a device driver that can be used to interface a device to a microprocessor based system (MAYBE??).

                                <p>For this project I developed the game "Fastest Gun Draw" on Zybo Board. 
                                    The game tries to replicate the famous scene of the Wild West duels. Where the person that
                                    can draw his gun faster than the other wins the duel. For a more detailed explanation 
                                    of how the game works see the video.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h6 class="subline">How this can benefit you and me?</h6>


                                <p>The most important benefit is that I can write software that can communicate with hardware peripherals.
                                     This means that I am able to read and interpret device specifications, and orginize software in a
                                     complex embedded application. Further more, I am capable of writing efficient interrupt service routines,
                                     improve software performance, and fix memory issues. Finally it is worths to mention that I used C
                                     and System Verilog languages to design the device-driver and the software.
                                      
                                </p>

                                <p>My target was to manufacture a 5 stage, pipelined, MIPS processor with error handling and forwarding.
                                     In other words, the main brain of the processor. I used a Basys3 FPGA for this project.
                                     I usefully accomplished my goal and I programed a little game using Assembly language.
                                     The game itself is simple moves around a character cursor that can change by setting the
                                     correct binary number. It also prints the character on the display as it moves.</p>

                                <p>Now I understand how computers execute code and I am more familiar with many of the important
                                     tradeoffs in the design of computer systems. I can read write simple programs in assembly language.
                                     I understand how common arithmetic and logic operations are performed by computers.
                                     I can perform RTL-Level design of datapath and control elements for a pipelined processor.</p>

                                <p>I worked with a team to construct a complex, multiplayer laser-tag system.
                                     Like most laser-tag system the main purpose of the game is to shoot laser bean to the
                                     photodetectors that are on the opponent’s body. The system utilizes a simple optical
                                     communication link where each player team is assigned a frequency.
                                     The laser pistol turns the LED on and off at rate assigned, then the target converts
                                     the received signal into digital signal. The signal then passes through bandpass
                                     filters and finally a software determines if the target was hit and by which player team.</p>

                                <h6 class="subline">How this can benefit you and me?</h6>

                                <p>I was able to implement my knowledge in analog designs by providing the shot-firing LED,
                                     shot-detecting photo-diode and associated analog electronics to interface with the FPGA board.
                                     In addition to this, I provide the signal-processing necessary to detect when a player has
                                     been shot and also to determine which player was the shooter.
                                     Further, I reinforce my ability to define, understand, and participate in team decision
                                     making processes. Finally, in this experience I was able to take high level customer requirements,
                                     identify from them the specifications a solution must meet, and formulate those specifications as
                                     an engineering problem.</p>
